CAW: The bird password manager
================================
CAW is a password manager that acts like a bird; sometimes really amazing and majestic, and sometimes a
gremlin that steals all of your shiny objects (but in this case "shiny objects" is your passwords)
(just kidding).  If a memory leak happens, you're not allowed to sue me, I made this project for
learning purposes, after all. It supports saving passwords into files, passwords with different
categories, passwords for different websites and specific logins for the aforementioned websites.
It's overall a pretty useful tool, but don't expect a GUI here, no! Developers with brains know
that all real and productive work happens in the terminal. So yeah, terminal based password
manager in C++.
